YATI (Yet Another Twitter Interface) - A TWITTER CLI FOR GEEKS
****************************
Starting as a bored-one-night hack, this gem scrapes your twitter feed for the 10 most recent posts, and displays them for you at the command line. More features to be added in the future. 

HOW TO USE:
---------------------------------
* To get the 10 newest tweets on your home timeline: $ python yati.py 
* To get the X newest tweets on your home timeline: $ python yati.py X
* To update your status: $ python yati.py --update [your status update, surrounded by quotes]
* To retweet a status (NEW!!): $ python yati.py --rt [tweet_#] **Note: The tweet # will appear as the #N right before the tweet when you make a call to Yati. e.g. $ yati.py # #1, #2, etc.. && yati.py --rt 2
